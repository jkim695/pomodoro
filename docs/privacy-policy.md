# Privacy Policy for Orchard

**Last Updated: February 1, 2026**

## Introduction

Orchard ("we", "our", or "the app") is a focus timer and app blocking application designed to help you stay productive. This privacy policy explains how we handle your information.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Collect

Orchard collects the following types of data to provide its core functionality:

- **Focus Session Data**: Duration preferences, session history, completion statistics, and streaks
- **App Blocking Preferences**: Your selection of apps and categories to block during focus sessions
- **Usage Data**: App usage information during monitored periods (collected via Apple's Screen Time APIs)
- **Rewards Data**: In-app currency balance, orb collection, and related progress

### How Data is Stored

**All data is stored locally on your device.** We do not transmit, collect, or store any of your personal information on external servers.

- Data is stored using Apple's standard storage mechanisms (UserDefaults and App Groups)
- Data remains on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties
- Data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app

## Third-Party Services

Orchard does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. We do not share your data with anyone.

## Apple Screen Time and Family Controls

Orchard uses Apple's Family Controls and Screen Time APIs to:

- Block access to selected apps during focus sessions
- Monitor app usage during active time limits
- Display shield screens when blocked apps are accessed

This functionality requires your explicit authorization and can be revoked at any time through your device's Screen Time settings.

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device, it is protected by your device's built-in security features, including:

- Device passcode/Face ID/Touch ID
- iOS data encryption
- App sandboxing

## Children's Privacy

Orchard does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. The app does not require account creation or collect any personally identifiable information.

## Your Rights

You have full control over your data:

- **Access**: View your data within the app's settings and statistics
- **Delete**: Remove all app data by uninstalling Orchard
- **Revoke Permissions**: Disable Screen Time access through iOS Settings > Screen Time

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.
